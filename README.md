### Description

**Wanna be a millionaire** is a trivia game made up by a set of questions that appear in random order when the player starts the game. Each question has 4 answers out of which only one is correct. The order the answers appear in the slots *A, B, C* and *D* is random, too.

### Player Controls

- **Mouse Left-Click** to select an answer.

### How To Play

The player should use his/her mouse to click the answer he/she thinks is correct. When an answer is picked, the game logic will highlight if the answer is correct or wrong. If the chosen answer is wrong, the correct one will be green-highlighted.

### Resources

The game is build from scratch based on the following [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/?couponCode=OF83024E).
The images were generated by Microsoft Copilot.

The game assets and/or sprites were either provided by the course as resources or downloaded from the web - [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets).
